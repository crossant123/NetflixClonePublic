## Goals of Project

I Created This Project over a week with the express goal to get a better understanding of React and to solidify my Knowledge of Firebase.

### React

> - This project handles React states and uses good practicable ways of passing data from an API and displaying it
> - This Showcase expresses React Component workflow and Frontent Design Fundumentals needed for use in Frameworks
> - Understanding Node.js Package handling and npm
> - Flexing a better grasp on Frontend manipulation through CSS and JS

### firebase V9

With the goal of this project requiring me to fully commit to seeing outdated Firebase V8 code and reproducing it with the Firebase V9 Library I felt I Accomplished:

> - Indepth Firestore creation and retrieval
> - Learning firebase cloud functions through extensions
> - Firebase authentication and user data handling
> - Understanding Firebase Version 8 to Version 9 _strengths_ and _weaknesses_
> - Understanding data structuring with a noSQL document DB
> - **GIGANTIC** growth in the understanding of Error handling and Logging / solving of errors with firebase
> - Found usage in Google Cloud Log Explorer for diagnosing bugs
